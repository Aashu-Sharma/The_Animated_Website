This is a frontend focused animated website which helped me dive deep into frontend design, learn to integrate gsap with react and create beautiful animations, and how such high quality animated websites are structured. 

✨ Key Highlights
Smooth, timeline-based animations using GSAP
Clean separation of animation logic and UI components
Modern animated layout inspired by real-world, high-end websites
Fully responsive design

🛠 Tech Stack
This Project is built upon React. 
For animations, as I mentioned above, I've used gsap to create smooth and beautiful animations that amplified the beauty of the website. 
For icons, I used react-icons library

This project was built by following and learning from a tutorial by JavaScript Mastery youtube channel.
While the core idea and guidance came from the tutorial, the purpose of building this project was to understand animation workflows, React–GSAP integration, and scalable frontend structure, not just replicate the output.

🧠 What I Learned
How to integrate GSAP cleanly within React components
Structuring animation timelines for maintainability
Designing motion that enhances UX rather than distracting users
How high-quality animated websites organize components and layout flow
